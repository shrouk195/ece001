		<h1>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. </h1>
		<h1>Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</h1>
		<h1>Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. </h1>
		<h1>Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).</h1>
		<h1>The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). </h1>
		<h1>Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. </h1>
		<h1>Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</h1>
